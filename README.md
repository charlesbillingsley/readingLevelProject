# CIS 365 Reading Level Project

This program analyzes a piece of text, determines the reading level using the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease Formula. It also can raise or lower the reading level to a new target reading level.

## Getting Started

Download the Python files and obtain some text samples in .txt files.

### Prerequisites

If you don't have the proper nltk libraries installed you will get a message when you run the program to install them. The process is simple. 
1. Run the python shell
2. Type import nltk
3. Type nltk.download()
4. Switch to the modules tab in the GUI
5. Download the libraries that were missing

### Running the Code

To run the program:
1. Open the command prompt/terminal/or an IDE such as PyCharm
2. Run the main.py file passing in your text
    ```
    main.py samplePassage.txt
    ```
3. To raise or lower the reading level pass in the proper command
    - ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `TODO ADD COMMANDS TO RAISE AND LOWER LEVEL!`
    ```
    main.py samplePassage.txt 
    ```
